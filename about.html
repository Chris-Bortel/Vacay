      <h3>I Am Ashley--I'm First Because of my "A"--I'm Learning Python and Other Stuff</h3>
      <br>  
      <p>My Name is Ashley and I’m a Software Developer! My love for technology started when I worked 
        for Apple as  a Genius back in 2008. After 5 years of working at Apple, I Joined the Navy 
        where I spent ~7 years doing construction (2.5 years) and working on submarines, in particular 
        the USS Michigan (SSGN 727), as a Fire Control Specialist (FT). While working as an FT I was a 
        system administrator for our classified networks on board as well as an operator for our
         weapons systems. I separated from the Navy in November 2019 which led me to my current 
         position as a Site Reliability Engineer for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. What I love most about 
         software development is the challenge it gives me to create solutions for everyday issues! 
         All my adult life I have looked for a job where there was always something to learn and 
         software development has proven to be it.

      <p>I am a Seattle-based software developer. Prior to pursuing this field, 
        I spent five years working in special education, where I thoroughly enjoyed working 
        with students and their families in order for them to get the most out of their education. 
        My interest in pursuing a career in web development stemmed from my love for design 
        and problem solving to help clients meet their needs. Thriving in an environment that 
        allows for constant learning and professional development, I am excited to see where 
        web development will take me.

      <h3>I Am Henry--I Am Awesome--I like Outdoors Stuff--And Stuff</h3>
      <br>  
      <p> I worked for years as a Wilderness Guide in the summers, Environmental Educator 
      in the fall and spring, and Snowboard Instructor in the winter. Life was good. In 
      search of a more sustainable career path, I made my way back to the Pacific Northwest 
      to work for Tesla as a sales rep in their Seattle showroom. The office views aren’t nearly 
      as good, but I’m able to continue working towards a cleaner and greener tomorrow thanks 
      to Tesla’s unique mission. As more and more people buy Tesla’s products directly through 
      the website, I long to gain the skills needed to better embrace this ‘online-only’ 
      purchase culture. I hope to be able to educate many more people about the benefits of 
      electric transportation and solar energy through web platforms, rather than relying on foot 
      traffic. Cue CodeFellows!

      <p>I’m a 25-year Air Force veteran who is passionate about social issues, specifically veteran- and
      economic inequality-centric issues, and I'd like to contribute to solutions in those areas. My 
      skills and experience  would be well-suited in a small company or team interested in developing 
      software to help people better process their experiences with combat-related stress, sexual assault, 
      addiction, violent crime, and other psychologically traumatic events.
