      <p> I worked for years as a Wilderness Guide in the summers, Environmental Educator 
      in the fall and spring, and Snowboard Instructor in the winter. Life was good. In 
      search of a more sustainable career path, I made my way back to the Pacific Northwest 
      to work for Tesla as a sales rep in their Seattle showroom. The office views aren’t nearly 
      as good, but I’m able to continue working towards a cleaner and greener tomorrow thanks 
      to Tesla’s unique mission. As more and more people buy Tesla’s products directly through 
      the website, I long to gain the skills needed to better embrace this ‘online-only’ 
      purchase culture. I hope to be able to educate many more people about the benefits of 
      electric transportation and solar energy through web platforms, rather than relying on foot 
      traffic. Cue CodeFellows!

      <p>I’m a 25-year Air Force veteran who is passionate about social issues, specifically veteran- and
      economic inequality-centric issues, and I'd like to contribute to solutions in those areas. My 
      skills and experience  would be well-suited in a small company or team interested in developing 
      software to help people better process their experiences with combat-related stress, sexual assault, 
      addiction, violent crime, and other psychologically traumatic events.
