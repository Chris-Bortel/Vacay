        <h3>Paradise in Phuket Thailand</h3>
         <p> <br><br>Backpacking in Phuket Thailand--Phuket is the biggest island in the country and 
          contains a wide range of beaches 
          and environments to see. This being the case, south of the island is a little over-developed 
          and crowded with tourists. The north part of the island however, is a paradise where you can 
          find peace and memorable experiences. 

          <br><br>Khao Phra Thaeo Wildlife Park--Take a trip to the Khao Phra Thaeo Conservation Development 
          and Extension Center, a 
          center focused on preserving the environment. The center contains a park which is home to a 
          number of endangered animals, and also contains giant trees in the midst of a dense forest. 
          Make sure to check out the Nam Tok Sai waterfall, which is located close to the park headquarters. 
          There is also a floating restaurant located in the mangroves! Admission is 200 THB ($6.25 USD)

          <br><br>Beautiful Vistas--Phuket has many viewpoints — there are 10 in total. Promthep tends to
           be the most popular, 
          but another great spot is the Kata viewpoint. Nothing is better than watching a golden sunset 
          from these points. Your camera will thank you!

          <br><br>Rent a Motorbike--This is the best way to get out and explore the island on your own. 
          Find your way to 
          Laem Singh Beach, a more secluded and laid-back spot with some great snorkeling opportunities. 
          Be careful — biking in Phuket can be a little dangerous. You can expect to pay about 200 THB 
          ($6.25 USD) a day for a bike.

          <br><br>Explore Sirinat National Park--This national park was founded in the early ’80s and 
          consists of three beach areas along the northwest coast of Phuket. It includes a couple of beaches, 
          including Nai Yang, Sai Kaew, and Mai Khao, as well as the mangrove forest where the saltwater and 
          freshwater mix. This is a good place for camping. During the spring, endangered Leatherback Turtles 
          come here to lay their eggs. Park entrance costs 200 THB ($6.25 USD).

          <br><br>Snorkel the waters--Phuket has over 33 beaches, all of them pretty incredible. While not 
          all of them are great for snorkeling, some of the best are Laem Singh Beach, Ao Sane, Ya Nui, and 
          Surin. You might want to bring your own gear, as renting can get a bit pricey. It is possible to 
          buy some cheap gear in Phuket if you look hard enough.
